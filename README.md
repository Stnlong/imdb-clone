About: This is a very basic project that incorporates react, redux, redux-saga, and material ui

Background: Started with react only, then added material ui, then added redux, then added redux-saga

TODO:

1. create a nav bar with user info. implement logging in and out
2. split out all the components in App.js

later:
1. create backend with db to store users
